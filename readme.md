URL Tools
=========

This is a simple MuraCMS plugin for creating alternative URLs.

For example if you have a URL like this:  
**http://www.mydomain.com/my-services-section/my-cool-service/**

You can setup an Alternative URL to look like this:  
**http://www.mydomain.com/cool**

When a user navigates to **/cool** it can:

* "Not Redirect" but pull the correct content
* do a Standard Redirect
* do a 301 Redirect

To set up:
----------

1. Edit the content that you would like to create an alternative URL for in the Site Manager
2. Click on the "Extended Attributes" Tab
3. Under the "URL Tools" section, enter an alternative filename; using the example above this would be: cool
4. Set your redirect method
5. Save
